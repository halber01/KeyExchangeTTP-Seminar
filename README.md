# KeyExchangeTTP-Seminar

The Trusted Thid Party (TTP) is an effective key exchange protocol for a small group of users. If the TTP plays an active role in all exchanges, it can only be build with symmetric ciphers. In addtition the TTP can provide secure channel bindings. The TTP is a statically secure exchange protocol, but on the other side it lacks Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
